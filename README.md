# Intelligence Waste Sorter System @ EL4705-04; "Mobile Application with IoT and AI Implementation Purposes."

## All the main features have been finished, only need some miscellaneous details such as Toast notifications, better Debug Log, better UI handling, and better graph X-axis scrolling.

---

Group project made for the Final Project Examination at the end of the 5th semester, relating to the subject on Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Embedded Systems.
